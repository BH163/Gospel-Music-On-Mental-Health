Abstract: In this report I will be analyzing the relationship between mental health and Gospel music. I have found a dataset on Kaggle titled, "Music & Mental Health Survey Results", which is a collection of survey results where participants were asked a variety questions about their music listening habits and their mental health. In this dataset I will look specifically at questions related to the Gospel genre of music and the self reported mental health of the participants. I aim to find an association between the mental health of the participants and how often they listen to Gospel music. I will use correlation to look for any linear relationships, as well as mutual information for any relationships that may not be captured linearly. I also will use scatter plots and bar charts to attempt to extract insights.
